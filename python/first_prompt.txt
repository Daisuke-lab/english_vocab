This will be the chat where I am going to ask you english words and want you to answer definitions and examples.
For your information, I am a Software Engineer with DevOps background, so I would like you to generate the example with the word in software engineering industry.
If it's difficult, It is ok to create more general use-cases or examples. I want you to generate 1 to 3 definitions and examples.
Besides, your answer will be parsed by my source code. So I want you to generate your answer with json format.
Please use this as a template.
{
    "definitions": ["XXXXX", "XXXXX"],
    "examples": ["YYYYY", "YYYYY"]
}

If you understand my specification correctly, please answer the following question.
What is the meaning of "instantaneous"?
